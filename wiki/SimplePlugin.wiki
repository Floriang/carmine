#summary An example for a simple plugin for Carmine.

It is extremely easy to add a plugin to carmine - just drop an assembly or even a plain C# or VB.NET source file into the {{{\Plugins\}}} subdirectory of your Carmine installation.

An example: Paste the code below in a textfile called {{{HelloWorld.cs}}} and put it into the {{{\Plugins\}}} subdirectory. It takes only a few seconds while Carmine recognizes this new plugin (no need to restart), compiles it on the fly and makes it available. Try it out by sending Carmine a {{{Hello}}} through your Jabber client.

{{{
using System;
using Saxx.Carmine;

public class Ping : Plugin {
    public override void Message(string from, string message) {
        if (message == "Hello")         
            SendMessage(from, "Hey!");
    }
}
}}}

The only thing you have to remember when writing a plugin is to derive your class from {{{Saxx.Carmine.Plugin}}}. This abstract class provides a lot of methods you can overwrite to add functionality to your plugin. The overridden method {{{Message}}} in the example above is probably the most important one - it gets called whenever somebody sends a message to Carmine.
