#summary How to install Carmine to run as a Windows service.

= Introduction =

Per default, Carmine is configured to run as a command-line application, but it is also able to run as a Windows service. Use the "service" command-line switch to start Carmine in service-mode.


= Details =

To install any application as a Windows service, you can use the "sc" command-line tool, that comes with the Windows Resource Kit. You probably have it installed already, but see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/251192 for mor information.

Open your command-line and run:

{{{sc create Carmine Binpath= "[YOUR PATH]\Saxx.Carmine.exe service" DisplayName= "Carmine"}}}

That adds a Carmine entry to the service registry. To start the service, just type:

{{{net start Carmine}}}

You can use Administrative Tools/Services to configure the startup type of the service (for now it is set to "Manual"). If you want to remove the service, type:

{{{sc delete Carmine}}}
