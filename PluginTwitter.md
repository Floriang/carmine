You can use this plugin to use Twitter from within your Jabber client. This is especially useful if you don't want to run a "dedicated" Twitter application, but still want to stay up-to-date about your friends.


# Usage #
### Enter your Twitter Credentials ###
First you need to enter your Twitter credentials. This is only required once, Carmine will save your credentials and associate them with your Jabber-account:

`twitter register <your Twitter username> <your Twitter password>`

### Getting notifications about new statuses of your friends ###
As soon as you entered your Twitter credentials, Carmine will automatically notify you when one of your friends updates his status (max. 2 minutes delay). But you can also check manually, if you want to:

`twitter`

### Setting a new status ###
You can set a new status on Twitter, just type:

`twitter <your new status message>`
